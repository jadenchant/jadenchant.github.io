    "text": "We as humans can easily determine if someone is saying something positive or negative, but computers and algorithms have struggled with this for decades. The context and sarcasm is not easily discernible to a computer. I will be attempting to predict the sentiment from movie reviews on IMDB.\nThe dataset IMDB Reviews contains reviews from the IMDB website and the sentiment towards that specific movie review. There is an exactly 50/50 split between positive sentiment and negative sentiment. I previously used this dataset for a Machine learning project using Long Short Term Memory. Using ML I was able to get a 88.8% accuracy in correctly identifying the sentiment. One major flaw with this dataset is the accuracy of the data. There are many examples where it says that the review has negative sentiment, but is actually a positive review. A better dataset would have their actual star rating system which the user would input and would not be up for interpretation.\n\nimdb_clean &lt;- imdb |&gt;\n  mutate(review = str_replace_all(review, \"https?://.+\", \"\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(review = str_replace_all(review, \"&lt;.*?&gt;\", \"\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(review = str_replace_all(review, \"[^\\x01-\\x7F]\", \"\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(sentiment = as.factor(sentiment)) |&gt;\n  mutate(sentiment = as.integer(sentiment)) |&gt;\n  mutate(sentiment = sentiment - 1) |&gt;\n  filter(tokenizers::count_words(review) &lt; 500) |&gt;\n  filter(tokenizers::count_words(review) &gt; 20)\n\n\nimdb |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(review, \"positive\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(sentiment) |&gt;\n  summarize(n = n())\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  sentiment     n\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1 negative    665\n2 positive    416\n\nimdb |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(review, \"negative\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(sentiment) |&gt;\n  summarize(n = n())\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  sentiment     n\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1 negative    338\n2 positive    363\n\n# sample()\n\nget_sentiments(\"bing\")\n\n# A tibble: 6,786 × 2\n   word        sentiment\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;    \n 1 2-faces     negative \n 2 abnormal    negative \n 3 abolish     negative \n 4 abominable  negative \n 5 abominably  negative \n 6 abominate   negative \n 7 abomination negative \n 8 abort       negative \n 9 aborted     negative \n10 aborts      negative \n# ℹ 6,776 more rows",

    "section": "What is LSTM?",
    "text": "What is LSTM?\nLong Short Term Memory is neural network that is ideal for processing and predicting data. LSTM is a recurrent neural network that uses context neurons for short term memory. These context neurons have their value updated when going through the current layer of the model. The neuron then resets at the end of the layer to zero. The purpose of the context neuron is to provide the recurrence of information back to previous neurons.\nLSTM uses gradient descent for the cost function of the neuron weights. Training a neural neural network uses backwards propagation between layers in the model.\nLSTM is also faster at learning and more successful than other models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). In order to use a neural network, the model needs lots of data to train the model. However, in the long run the model is be better than using a linear regression model where each variable is every word.\n\nLSTM Models use Three Gates (in this order):\n\nForget Gate\n\nThis gate determines what data is forgotten based on previous hidden neural network layers and the new data being inputted.\n\nInput Gate\n\nThis gate determines what data should be added to the long-term memory based on previous hidden layers and new data. This gate uses tanh activation [-1,1] for long term memory portion and sigmoid activation [0,1] for the filtering portion. Then these outputs are multiplied together and then added to the layer neuron.\n\nOutput Gate\n\nThis gate determines what data should be passed through to the next neural network layer. The gate uses tanh activation for outputting to a new layer."

The ending of the review is what is important for the overall sentiment of the text. The model struggles with understanding the sentiment throughout the entire review. The important section of the review is the ending which contradicts the initial positive review.\nNow let’s look at one of the false negatives:\n\na lovely little b picture with all the usual joe lewis touches people ripping up pillows and auras of lurking fear also alas an ending that comes out of nowhere because apparently the auteur has lost interest in the movie or perhaps because as a b picture it has to fit into a slot\n\nThe start of the review appears to be positive which the model understands. However at the end of the review, the tone shifts to be negative sentiment. This is one issue with this dataset is that some of the reviews can be difficult to understand if a review is positive or not. In this case the individual who labeled this data had the opinion that it had positive sentiment towards the movie. In my opinion, I believe that the review has negative sentiment towards the movie due to the last line of the review.\nAnother main issue with this model is that it does not understand sarcasm. Sarcasm is difficult to train for; more complex models today have difficulty understanding it."
