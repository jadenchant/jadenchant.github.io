MEDIA AGENCIES
U.S. AGENCY FOR GLOBAL MEDIA
Mora Namdar
MISSION STATEMENT
The mission of United States Agency for Global Media (USAGM) is to inform, 
engage, and connect people around the world in support of freedom and democ -
racy.1 However, this mission statement does not reflect the current work of the 
agency. The mission is noble, but the execution is lacking. To fulfill its mission, 
USAGM should also aim to present the truth about America and American policy
not parrot Americas adversaries propaganda and talking points.2
OVERVIEW
Originally formed as the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) in 1994, the BBG 
changed its name in 2018 to the United States Agency for Global Media. The USAGM is 
a sub-Cabinet agency of the U.S. government with a budget of just under $1 billion. The 
agency oversees two government broadcasting networks: the Voice of America (VOA) 
and the Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB). USAGM also oversees 100 percent of the 
grant funding for several independent grantee organizations, including the Middle 
East Broadcasting Network (MBN), Radio Free Asia (RFA), Radio Free Europe/Radio 
Liberty (RFE/RL), and the newly formed Open Technology Fund (OTF).3
 lThe Voice of America  provides news and information in 48 languages to 
a weekly audience of more than 326 million people worldwide. For morethan 80 years, VOA journalists have supplied news and information about 
the U.S., audience-specific regions of interest and concern, and the world at 
large. VOA radio and television signals are broadcast to approximately 3,500 
affiliates, and satellite transmissions reach countries where free speech is 
banned or where civil society is under threat.4
VOA uses digital, web, and mobile media as well, which, while sometimes 
useful in propagating valuable information globally, has created specific 
violations of the agencys prohibition against broadcasting to the domestic 
U.S. audienceparticularly with regard to flagrantly political content, as 
has been the practice with recent and current VOA content directors and 
managers.5 The network once had a generally well-received brand value, 
but it has deteriorated under decades of poor leadership and a loss of its 
once-prized unbiased reporting. There are bright spots within VOA, but 
mismanagement and declining production values have diluted its once-
great reputation as a singular voice in American news broadcasting abroad.
 lThe Office of Cuba Broadcasting  oversees Radio and Television Marti, a 
multimedia hub of news, information, and analysis that provides the people 
of Cuba with programs through satellite television, radio, and digital media. 
These programs present news and information about Cubas oppressive 
government from the outside world that would otherwise be heavily 
restricted.6 The OCB remains a critical avenue of truth to the Cuban people 
but has been threatened with crippling budget and operational constraints, 
including empathetic attitudes toward Communist Cuban leadership 
coupled with organizational hostility toward the OCB by certain elements 
of USAGM leadership. During the Biden Administration, the OCB has been 
threatened with closure, while also suffering chilling reductions in force.7
 lThe Middle East Broadcasting Network  is an Arabic-language news 
organization with a weekly audience of 27.4 million people in 22 countries 
in the Middle East and North Africa. The MBN consists of two television 
networks, radio, websites, and social media platforms. Together, they deliver 
news and analysis on the region, American policies, and Americana. The 
MBN has correspondents throughout the Middle East and North Africa.8
 lRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty  is a private, nonprofit, multimedia 
broadcasting corporation that serves as a surrogate media source in 27 
languages and 23 countries, including Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Russia, 
and Ukraine.Founded in the early days of the Cold War (Radio Free Europe in 1949 
and Radio Liberty in 1953) and merged in 1976, Radio Free Europe and 
Radio Liberty were intended to execute edgy and daring information 
operations and unrestricted news reporting deep behind the Iron Curtain. 
Unfortunately, like other broadcast organizations under USAGM, RFE/RL 
has surrendered much of its rich history to an approach that favors political 
trends as opposed to operations that support and represent America abroad. 
While there are some bright spots within RFE/RL, much of the network has 
redundant programming with certain VOA language services, often with 
competing, counterproductive, or dissimilar messaging.
The recent addition of RFE/RLs Hungarian-language service, Szabad 
Europa, falls outside the intended scope of RFE/RLs charter by targeting a 
democratically elected, pro-American European and NATO ally.
Not least, RFE/RL has been plagued by several serious espionage-related 
security risks within its ranks.9
 lRadio Free Asia  is a private, nonprofit multimedia news corporation that 
brings news and uncensored content to people in six Asian countries that 
restrict free speech, freedom of the press, and access to reliable information. 
RFA also provides educational and cultural programming, as well as forums 
for audiences to engage in open dialogue and freely express opinions. RFA 
utilizes on-the-ground reporters and networks of in-country sources, citizen 
journalists, and eyewitnesses who provide leads, tips, images, and video.10
Several reports from the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) were released 
showing waste and self-dealing, including security vulnerabilities and RFA lead -
ership awarding insiders millions of dollars of grant funding.11 For example, as 
the OIG stated in one report, the then-president of RFA established the Free -
dom2Connect Foundation (Foundation) and thereafter awarded two contracts, 
totaling $1.2 million to the foundation she herself founded.12 Furthermore:
[The] OIG found that RFA did not comply with Federal procurement 
requirements for grantees. OIG identified instances in which RFA and 
its agents did not comply with OMB [Office of Management and Budget] 
conflict-of-interest procurement requirements for grantees. Specifically, 
OIG found that RFA entered into 14 contracts, totaling $4.0 million 
(51 percent of the amount of OTF FYs 2012 and 2013 project-related 
contracts), with organizations that had some affiliation with either RFA 
officials or members of OTF Advisory Council.13This same leadership proceeded to wastefully form the Open Technology 
Fund as its own independent grantee with the help of USAGM senior 
management prior to the tenure of Trump-appointed leadership.
 lThe Open Technology Fund s  goal is to provide funding to support 
the research, development, and implementation of Internet freedom 
technologies that circumvent censorship. OTF was formed under dubious 
circumstances by using consolidation rules to usurp the mission and 
funding of USAGMs pre-existing Office of Internet Freedom (OIF), which 
funded far more diverse technologies with much greater transparency. OTF , 
however, operates with far less transparency and strictly restricts funding to 
open source technology. OTF does not support any technology with even 
partially closed source code, notwithstanding that such closed-source 
code would provide more protection against hacking.
Although OTF touts large user numbers, this could not be substantiated 
upon requests for information, and it was discovered by former senior 
USAGM leadership that OTF makes extremely small, insubstantial 
donations to much larger messaging applications and technology to bolster 
its unsubstantiated claims.14 Despite its vibrant self-lobbying and publicity 
efforts, OTF remains a wasteful and redundant boondoggle. Its grantee 
status was suspended by Trump-appointed USAGM leadership for a number 
of reasons, including noncompliance with its grant terms and for actions 
that resulted in several fraud and waste investigations.15
The OIF , which predates OTF , was historically under USAGMs Office of 
Chief Strategy Officer and for years had been performing the same tasks as 
OTF within USAGM headquarters for the benefit of all USAGM broadcast 
networks. With much greater transparency, OIF succeeded with fewer staff 
while simultaneously fielding more diverse and robust technologies. Absent 
a meaningful organizational impact analysis to justify the wastefulness of 
the decision-making process, OTF usurped the entire OIF budget and was 
set up as a new grantee organization.
Exacerbating matters, OIF was shut down in order to provide massive 
grants to the opaque activities of OTF and its founding leadership, who went 
on a free-spending boondoggle for high-end Washington, D.C., office space, 
furnishings, and top salaries for its leadership team. Numerous career staff 
whistleblowers came forward to sound the alarm about OTF to Trump-
appointed leadership, citing concerns about the OIG reports, wasteful 
spending, and other substantive performance matters.16 Nonetheless, theBiden Administration reinstated OTF to full operational status and ceased 
all investigations immediately after assuming office.
ATTEMPTS AT REFORM
Late in the Trump Administration, following the long-delayed Senate confirma -
tion of Michael Pack as USAGM Chief Executive Officer (CEO),17 agency leadership 
rapidly initiated long-overdue and necessary reforms,18 including security reforms 
repeatedly requested by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Office 
of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) that had been ignored by USAGM 
leadership.19 Unfortunately, as was the case with the OTF , the Biden Administration 
immediately reinstated personnel who had been fired for gross security violations, 
placing the agency back into its previously failed postureone that poses a danger 
to national security.
The Firewall Saga.  The vital error in USAGMs current organizational/cul -
tural calculus is the agencys selective application of a journalistic firewall. The 
amorphous interpretation of a firewall shifts, depending on which Administration 
is in office and who is asking questions.
Although a firewall should ensure journalistic independence, it has been used 
without formal regulation for decades in order to shirk legitimate oversight of 
everything from promoting adversaries propaganda to ignoring journalistic safety. 
Often, the firewall is touted when journalists are either promoting anti-American 
propaganda that parrots adversarial regime talking points or promoting politically 
biased viewpoints in opposition to the VOA charter.20
Such weak oversight, alien to any other large media network or news organi -
zationparticularly one derivative of U.S. foreign policy and national security 
goalswas erroneously enshrined in a document known as the Firewall Regula -
tion.21 The Firewall Regulation was entered into the Federal Register  on the eve 
of the Senate confirmation of President Donald Trumps USAGM CEO, Michael 
Pack. It was the quintessential midnight reg designed to throttle the statutory 
and executive authority of the agency head. It stipulated that agency management, 
by standards unknown to most large broadcast companies, was forbidden from 
engaging in oversight and direction of content in any wayeven false content. 
It ran counter to the law, including the SmithMundt Act,22 and it was harmful 
to the agency itself and to the foreign policy and national security goals of the 
U.S. government.
Even content that went well beyond fair and accurate reporting on U.S. domestic 
and political problems could not be reined in by front office leadership under the 
Firewall Regulation. Soon, VOAs White House correspondent was posting content 
highly critical of, and personally insulting to, the U.S. Presidentin contradiction 
of VOAs own journalistic standards, policies, and procedures. USAGM career offi -
cials considered such content sacrosanct and bravely independent journalisticcontent protected by the spirit of the Firewall Regulationdespite ample evi -
dence to the contrary.
Late in the Trump Administration, USAGM political leadership, following an 
intensive U.S. Department of Justice review, revoked the Firewall Regulation over 
the protests of journalistic organizationsnone more vociferous than VOA itself.23 
While the abuses of the Firewall Regulation are particularly disconcerting, they 
encompass just a fraction of similar overreaches of the agencys journalistic mission.
Current and former USAGM/VOA leadership who wanted to maintain virtually 
zero accountability and oversight waged a campaign of interference, resistance, and 
disinformation to stifle change at the agency. Perhaps not coincidentally, various 
media outlets with relationships to former and future USAGM leadership published 
near-daily criticisms of Trump Administration appointees and also of grantee organi -
zation leaders who were appointed by CEO Pack to implement long-overdue reforms.24
Agency Mission Failure.  Currently, the USAGM, by and large, is not fulfilling 
its mission, which remains so ill-defined and ambiguous that it enables the organi -
zation to go about its business largely unguided with little to no oversight. Rather 
than providing news and information in an accurate, reliable way that promotes 
and supports freedom and democracy, the agency is mismanaged, disorganized, 
ineffective, and rife with waste and redundancy.
These shortfalls are either oriented toward, or directly contribute to, the agen -
cys media organizations joining the mainstream medias anti-U.S. chorus and 
denigrating the American storyall in the name of so-called journalistic inde -
pendence. Indeed, content during the Trump Administration was rife with typical 
mainstream media talking points assailing the President and his staff. The few 
bright spots within VOA and the OCB are often stifled instead of supported. Top-
level talent often leaves the agency or is met with obstacles rather than support.25 
Opportunities for modernization and effective strategy are ignored, and wasteful 
spending and misallocation of resources are the norm in an environment in which 
nepotism is rampant and political gamesmanship protects bad actors.
Amanda Bennett26 was confirmed as USAGM CEO in 2022 after two years 
of being blocked by several Members of Congress. Legal advocacy organization 
America First Legal Foundation even wrote to President Joe Biden asking him to 
withdraw her nomination,27 citing several severe national security failures while 
she was director of VOA.28 Her tenure as director during the Obama Administration 
(and her holdover into the beginning of the Trump Administration) was marred 
with operational failures, security failures, and credibility failures. Those failures 
are reportedly ongoing during her current tenure as CEO.29
NECESSARY REFORMS
Security Issues.  The Office of Personnel Management30 and the Office of 
the Director of National Intelligence flagged severe security failures during fourextensive investigations of the USAGM, each conducted during a 10-year period 
between 2010 and 2020.31 Security personnel and former agency senior leadership 
ignored these issues and allowed them to persist.32
In brief, the USAGM is vulnerable to exploitation by foreign spies. During the 
last six months of the Trump Administration, known foreign intelligence opera -
tives were removed from the OCB and RFE/RL. During the 10-year period between 
2010 and 2020, both the OPM and the ODNI found that the USAGMs Office of 
Security (under the Office of Management) had grossly ignored and flouted many 
of the federal governments most critical and long-standing information and per -
sonnel security protocols, regulations, and practices.33
During the investigative periodin which the findings were largely, if not 
wholly, ignored by agency senior leadershipover 1,500 USAGM personnel 
(nearly 40 percent of its total workforce) were performing their Tier 3 and Tier 5 
national-security-sensitive positions with falsified and/or unauthorized suitabil -
ity-for-employment determinations and with access to sensitive federal buildings 
and information systems. In many cases, records (including Social Security num -
bers), were falsified or replaced with notional placeholders, and fingerprints (in 
many dozens of cases) were never submitted to the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
for basic background investigations.
By the time these issues were addressed by members of the Trump Adminis -
tration, more than 500 personnel with unauthorized access and clearances had 
left the USAGM and rolled into other federal agencies with reciprocal clearance 
authorizations. Many others disappeared into U.S. society. As of January 2021, the 
USAGM had not yet determined the whereabouts of these individuals.34
The USAGM must never again be entrusted with delegated authority over its 
personnel security programs and suitability determinations until such time as it 
can prove that these failures will not happen again. These responsibilities must 
remain with the Department of Defense and the Office of Personnel Management, 
to which they were transferred in the final weeks of the Trump Administration.
Journalists Security.  Agency journalists, both on and off American soil, have 
faced danger,35 yet their superiors have done little to protect them. Whistleblowers 
and Trump Administration officials found that protection of USAGM American 
and foreign journalists employed by USAGM networks and grantee organizations 
was severely lacking.
Against often-significant resistance, political appointees forced action to 
enable broadcasters (who were under verified threats) to broadcast from remote 
locations while being protected by federal law enforcement officers. Likewise, 
political appointees met resistance from senior career officials when insisting 
that foreign-based journalists in high-risk countries make their locations known 
to the agency in the event they required rescue, extraction, or safe housing. Such 
safety measures, argued career officials, would somehow represent a violation ofjournalistic independence. With only rare exceptions, resistance to the most basic 
journalist safety measures was the knee-jerk response from USAGM career officials.
Wasting Taxpayer Dollars.  The USAGMS current operations, properly man -
aged, can be conducted on less than $700 million per year. Prior to the arrival of 
President Donald Trumps appointees in June 2020, budgeting, financial responsi -
bility, and spending totaled over $800 million per year, with virtually no oversight 
or supervision. Waste, unnecessary spending, nepotism for pet projects, redundant 
programs, and unnecessary hiring abounded.
Consolidation and Reduction of Redundant Services.  Currently, the USAGM 
funds numerous redundant services through its own offices, through Voice of Amer -
ica and the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, and through its grantees. For example, VOA 
has a Mandarin-language service but also funds redundant services through Radio 
Free Asia. VOA also has a Farsi-language service that duplicates one funded through 
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Surplus services in the same languages are often 
unnecessary and counterproductive. Fiscal responsibility and transparency should 
return to the USAGM, with consolidation being a cornerstone of the strategy.
As noted previously, the Open Technology Fund duplicates activities that 
already existed at the USAGM in the Office of Internet Freedom. Numerous career 
whistleblowers came forward to sound the alarm to President Trumps USAGM 
political team about OTFs abuse and overreach.36 Its opaque, expensive, and 
unnecessary usurpation of an existing USAGM office is an egregious example of 
government waste and illustrates the general disdain for U.S. taxpayers that is rife 
within this agency. Full reinstatement of OIF would allow full agency and congres -
sional oversight into how so-called Internet freedom money is being spent.37
J-1 Visa Program Abuses.  Rather than use the appropriate I visa38 intended 
for foreign journalists, the USAGM uses the J-1 cultural exchange visas to allow 
foreign nationals to transition easily into jobs that American citizens with cul -
tural and linguistic expertise could satisfy. The J-1 visa is intended for cultural and 
academic exchange programs, among others none  of which include journalism.39 
Additionally, J-1 visas are meant for non-immigrant temporary exchanges. The 
USAGMs J-1 visa holders often go on to apply for permanent residency, which 
violates the intention of this visa.
Shortwave Transmission Upgrades and Improvements.  Non-web-based 
technologies that are proven and durable, such as shortwave radio transmission 
stations, have been grossly deemphasized in budgeting in favor of newer web-
based technologies. This move is dangerously short-sighted and puts the U.S. at a 
perilous strategic disadvantage in the event of a major conflict, particularly with 
Russia or China.
There is great concern about the vulnerability of undersea cable trunks that 
make up the Internet cloud. The vast majority of global Internet traffic95 per -
centis transmitted through these cables, including news transmissions andweb-based content produced by the USAGMs broadcast networks. While the 
robust and popular use of the Internet is ideal during peacetime, during times of 
major conflict, widespread damage to the undersea cables that carry communi -
cations across the globe can reasonably be expected. Long-lasting power outages 
are also likely, such as those Ukraine experienced in the aftermath of Russias 
2022 invasion.
The USAGMs responsibility for the only U.S. global shortwave radio capability is 
of critical strategic importance if America is to carry its message to people seeking 
information and freedom within conflict zones. Shortwave technologies also make 
it possible to carry broadcasts in areas where Internet traffic is severely restricted, 
as it is in many authoritarian states today.
ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES
Personnel.  Personnel is one of the biggest concerns for the USAGM and its 
grantees. Attracting talented staff who will stay and letting go of poorly perform -
ing personnel are hurdles. Additionally, whistleblowers have come forward with 
numerous credible allegations of illegal nepotism and improper hiring practic -
es.40 Past agency leaders have ignored national security procedures when hiring 
and have failed to adequately vet staff.41 Government hiring policies and federal 
law must be followed, and serious policy changes must be implemented to end 
these practices.
Relevant Government Entities
 lThe White House.  As an executive branch agency, the USAGM ostensibly 
should report to the President and coordinate activities with the 
National Security Council (NSC)especially given the direct and implied 
national security aspects of the agencys messaging globally. However, 
there currently is no specific office in the White House or NSC liaison 
for the USAGM.
The original network, VOA, functioned under the Office of Coordinator 
of Information as early as 1941, the War Departments Office of War 
Information from 1942 to 1945, the State Department from 1945 to 1953, 
and the U.S. Information Agency from 1953 until the creation of the 
independent Broadcasting Board of Governors in 1999. Although some 
oversight and management functions of the agency are provided by the 
State Department, the USAGM otherwise has little connectivity to larger 
departments or agencies and even less to the White House. With the 
dissolution of the U.S. Information Agency in 1999, the USAGM has virtually 
been under its own supervision and guidance. The results have been dismal. lThe State Department.  VOA was most effective before and during the 
Cold War when it was under the direct supervision and control of the War 
and State Departments, respectively. If VOA is not put in the direct chain of 
command under the NSC, serious consideration should be given to putting 
VOA under the direct supervision of the Office of Global Public Affairs at the 
Department of State. The Office of Global Public Affairs was formed during 
the Trump Administration by consolidation of the State Departments Bureau 
of International Information Programs and Bureau of Global Public Affairs.
Ensuring that taxpayer-funded TV, radio, and messaging tells Americas 
story is imperative and should be coordinated with the existing foreign-
language social media platforms at the State Department. Currently, VOAs 
foreign-language TV programming is unreliable in telling Americas story, 
given its amorphous interpretation of its independence firewall and its 
waning adherence to certain provisions of the SmithMundt Act depending 
on which political party is in office.
The VOA firewall is meant to protect broadcasters from government 
interference with content; however, USAGM staff have abused the firewall 
and used it as an offensive measure to block oversight. Additionally, the 
SmithMundt Act stipulates that USAGM services are meant to tell the 
American story abroadnever to domestic audiencesbut the agency has 
used its taxpayer funding to promote partisan messaging in the U.S. One of 
the most egregious examples was when, in 2020, it bought ads on its foreign-
language social media sites to disseminate a Biden campaign ad and targeted 
it to a major Muslim population in Michigan.42 Moreover, VOA often airs 
foreign adversaries propaganda, which is antithetical to its congressionally 
mandated core mission. State Department oversight or command may be 
one way to ensure that VOA and the rest of the USAGM returns and adheres 
to its original mission.
Clear lines of command and communications between the USAGM and an 
appropriate office of the National Security Council are also sorely lacking, 
as has been any reasonable accountability for USAGM senior leadership 
and strategy. The State Departments Assistant Secretary for Global Public 
Affairs and Undersecretary for Diplomacy and Public Affairs should also 
be in the accountability loop for agency actions. While the U.S. Secretary of 
State technically has a seat on the board of the agency, it is a toothless seat 
that is often deferred to the undersecretary and/or assistant secretaries 
noted above. This position should be relevant and directive when U.S. 
foreign policy and strategic communications are at stake.For example, the years-long delay in confirming the Trump-appointed 
CEO left disastrous holdover leadership from the previous Administration. 
Employing effective leadership, even in an acting capacity, while a new CEO is 
awaiting Senate confirmation is necessary to prevent a repeat of this behavior.
 lCongress.  The USAGM receives its budget and mandates directly from 
Congress. Often, changes in major functions at the agency happen because 
of the lobbying efforts of a few connected individualsoften grantees 
lobbying for more funds and less accountability. Those changes can and 
do handcuff leadership from any meaningful oversight. An overhaul of the 
agency with review from Congress to modernize, streamline, and reduce 
waste must be done with congressional support.
 lKey nongovernmental stakeholders, allies, and non-allies.  These include 
industry groups, nonprofits, trade associations, foundations, and activist 
organizations, for example, America First Legal Foundation,43 USAGM 
Watch,44 BBG-USAGM Watch,45 and Whistleblower Protection Project.46
CONCLUSION
The USAGM is a story of a lost opportunity both to help restore the worlds con -
fidence in the promise and ideals of America and to set a high mark for journalistic 
integrity and unbiased reporting. These two areas have suffered severely under two 
decades of USAGM mismanagement and lack of oversight. Finding solutions to 
these problems and the restoration of the agencys networks must be the priorities 
of future agency leadership.
To accomplish this, the USAGM must be fully reformed top to bottom with 
congressional and White House support. The possibility of consolidating not only 
the agencys subparts, but bringing the entire agency under the supervision of the 
NSC, the State Department, or both would dramatically aid that reform.
If the de facto  aim of the agency simply remains to compete in foreign markets 
using anti-U.S. talking points that parrot Americas adversaries propaganda, then 
this represents an unacceptable burden to the U.S. taxpayer and a negative return 
on investment. In that case, the USAGM should be defunded and disestablished. 
If, however, the agency can be reformed to become an effective tool, it would be 
one of the greatest tools in Americas arsenal to tell Americas story and promote 
freedom and democracy around the world.
